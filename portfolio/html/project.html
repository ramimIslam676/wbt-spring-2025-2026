    <h1>Project Information</h1>
    <p>I have worked on several projects that have allowed me to apply my web development skills and gain valuable
        experience. Here are some of the projects I have been involved in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Portfolio Website:</strong> I created a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills,
            projects, and experience. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it features a responsive
            design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Blog Platform:</strong> I developed a blog platform where users can create and manage their own
            blogs. The platform includes features such as user authentication, post creation and editing, and comment
            functionality. It was built using a combination of front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and
            back-end technologies (Node.js, Express, MongoDB).</li>
        <li><strong>E-commerce Website:</strong> I worked on an e-commerce website for a local business. The website
            allows customers to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases online. It was built
            using a full-stack approach with React for the front-end and Node.js with Express for the back-end.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These projects have not only helped me develop my technical skills but also taught me important lessons in
        project management, teamwork, and problem-solving. I am excited to continue working on new projects and further
        expand my knowledge in web development.</p>
