    <h1>Experience Information</h1>
    <p>I have had the opportunity to work on several projects that have allowed me to apply my web development skills in
        real-world scenarios. Here are some of the experiences I have had:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internship at XYZ Company:</strong> During my internship, I worked on developing a responsive
            website for a local business. I collaborated with a team of designers and developers to create a
            user-friendly interface and implemented features such as contact forms and image galleries.</li>
        <li><strong>Freelance Web Developer:</strong> I have also taken on freelance projects where I designed and
            developed websites for small businesses and individuals. These projects have helped me gain experience in
            client communication, project management, and delivering high-quality work within deadlines.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong> I have contributed to open source projects on GitHub, where I
            have fixed bugs, added new features, and improved documentation. This has allowed me to collaborate with
            other developers and learn from their expertise.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me valuable lessons in teamwork,
        problem-solving, and time management. I am excited to continue building my experience in web development and
        take on new challenges in the future.</p>
